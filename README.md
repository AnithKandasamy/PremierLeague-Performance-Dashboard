# Premier League Performance Dashboard

## Introduction

As a student aspiring to build a career in Data Science, i did this personal side project to apply my knowledge about Power BI on a topic I am interested in. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a dashboard using Power BI to analyze data from an Excel file retracing performances of Premier League's clubs over 22 years. 

## How to access the dashboard

You can access the final result just by installing the PowerPoint located in this project.

## Possible Improvements 

It would be interesting to now retrace to find the key reasons of each teams performances via other variables and try to predict using machine learning, future performances of a club.
